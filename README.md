# iris-website

Gatsby static site hosted and deployed via Netlify.

## Development

**USE YARN NOT NPM**

## Deployment

Run on your local machine to run the predeploy and deploy scripts.

```
yarn deploy
```
This will build the site on the `gh-pages` branch. When Netlify recognizes a change on this branch, it will redeploy the site.
