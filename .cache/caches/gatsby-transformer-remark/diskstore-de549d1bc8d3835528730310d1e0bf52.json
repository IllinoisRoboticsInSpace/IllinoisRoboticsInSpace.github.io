Example project ideas\ninclude building out a simple quantum simulator, implementing algorithms on\nquantum frameworks (i.e. IBM Q Experience, Google CIRQ), and any other projects\nthat members pitch. As an organization we do not dictate the projects people work\non; it's whatever you and your peers want to delve into! Instead QUIUC will try\nto be a resource to those projects through infrastructure, seeking out faculty\nmentors, or connecting that project with industry.</p>"}
