We cater\nto two different paths: crash courses and topic groups.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The crash course series focuses on solidifying the introductory and pre-requisite material for those new\nto the field. This series covers introductory quantum physics such as superposition,\nteleportation, and quantum logic gates (to name a few), as well as the requisite\nmath and Python needed to work on these problems. All of the crash courses include\nhand-on demos or code samples, as well as problem sets for those that want extra\npractice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The topic groups section is targeted towards more experienced members\nand is more open-ended. The model is simple: anyone that has taken a deep dive\ninto a specific topic (i.e. worked on a project surrounding it) and wants to\nshare what they learned can put on a session. The session would consist of a\npresentation to the topic, and an informal group discussion about it. The goal\nof topic groups is to brain storm ideas for new research projects, and explore\nthe tools available for these.</p>"}
